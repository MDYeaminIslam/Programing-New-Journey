# My Programming Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my programming journey! This repository is a reflection of my commitment to becoming a better programmer and problem solver. After a long break, Iâ€™m restarting my coding journey with a focus on **problem-solving**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, and eventually **AI/ML**. Here, Iâ€™ll document my daily progress, store the problems I solve, and share my thoughts along the way.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- **Short-term (Next 3-4 months):**
  - Rebuild my coding skills in JavaScript and Python.
  - Solve 100+ problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codewars.
  - Learn the basics of AI/ML and build small projects.
- **Long-term (6-12 months):**
  - Transition into an AI Software Engineer role.
  - Contribute to open-source projects.
  - Build a portfolio of projects showcasing my skills.

## ðŸ—“ Daily Progress
I aim to spend **1 hour every day** coding and problem-solving. Below is a log of my daily progress:

### Week 1: Rebuilding Foundations
- **Day 1**: Refreshed JavaScript basics (variables, loops, functions). Solved 3 easy problems on HackerRank.
- **Day 2**: Learned ES6 features (arrow functions, destructuring). Practiced array manipulation problems.
- **Day 3**: Explored JavaScript objects and solved frequency-counting problems.
- **Day 4**: Started learning Python basics (variables, loops, conditionals).
- **Day 5**: Practiced Python data structures (lists, dictionaries).
- **Day 6**: Solved string manipulation problems in JavaScript.
- **Day 7**: Built a simple to-do list app using JavaScript.

### Week 2: Problem-Solving and Python
- **Day 8**: Learned about two-pointer technique and solved related problems.
- **Day 9**: Explored hash maps and solved problems like two-sum and anagrams.
- **Day 10**: Started learning NumPy and Pandas basics.
- **Day 11**: Solved math-based problems (Fibonacci, prime numbers).
- **Day 12**: Planned a mini project (weather app using an API).
- **Day 13**: Implemented the core functionality of the weather app.
- **Day 14**: Polished the project and reflected on my progress.

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections
- **Day 1**: It feels great to be coding again! I realized how much I missed the thrill of solving problems.
- **Day 5**: Switching to Python was smoother than I expected. The syntax is clean and beginner-friendly.
- **Day 10**: Solving problems daily is helping me build confidence. Iâ€™m starting to recognize patterns in problems.
- **Day 14**: Building a small project was rewarding. It reminded me why I love programmingâ€”creating something from scratch is magical.
